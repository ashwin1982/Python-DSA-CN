1. Min Cost Path Problem
Send Feedback
An integer matrix of size (M x N) has been given. Find out the minimum cost to reach from the cell (0, 0) to (M - 1, N - 1).
From a cell (i, j), you can move in three directions:
1. ((i + 1),  j) which is, "down"
2. (i, (j + 1)) which is, "to the right"
3. ((i+1), (j+1)) which is, "to the diagonal"
The cost of a path is defined as the sum of each cell's values through which the route passes.
 Input format :
The first line of the test case contains two integer values, 'M' and 'N', separated by a single space. They represent the 'rows' and 'columns' respectively, for the two-dimensional array/list.

The second line onwards, the next 'M' lines or rows represent the ith row values.

Each of the ith row constitutes 'N' column values separated by a single space.
Output format :
Print the minimum cost to reach the destination.
Constraints :
1 <= M <= 10 ^ 2
1 <= N <=  10 ^ 2

2. LCS - Problem
Send Feedback
Given two strings, S and T with lengths M and N, find the length of the 'Longest Common Subsequence'.
For a string 'str'(per se) of length K, the subsequences are the strings containing characters in the same relative order as they are present in 'str,' but not necessarily contiguous. Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to K.
Example :
Subsequences of string "abc" are:  ""(empty string), a, b, c, ab, bc, ac, abc.
Input format :
The first line of input contains the string S of length M.

The second line of the input contains the String T of length N.
Output format :
Print the length of the 'Longest Common Subsequence'.
Constraints :
0 <= M <= 10 ^ 3
0 <= N <= 10 ^ 3

Time Limit: 1sec
Sample Input 1 :
adebc
dcadb
Sample Output 1 :
3
Explanation of the Sample Input 1 :
Both the strings contain a common subsequence 'adb', which is the longest common subsequence with length 3. 
Sample Input 2 :
ab
defg
Sample Output 2 :
0
Explanation of the Sample Input 2 :
The only subsequence that is common to both the given strings is an empty string("") of length 0.

4. Matrix Chain Multiplication
Send Feedback
Given a chain of matrices A1, A2, A3,.....An, you have to figure out the most efficient way to multiply these matrices. In other words, determine where to place parentheses to minimize the number of multiplications.
You will be given an array p[] of size n + 1. Dimension of matrix Ai is p[i - 1]*p[i]. You need to find minimum number of multiplications needed to multiply the chain.
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of n. The following line contains n+1 integers, that denote the value of elements of array p[].
Output Format:
The first and only line of output prints the minimum number of multiplication needed.
Constraints :
1 <= n <= 100
Time limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:

10 15 20 25
Sample Output 1:
8000
Sample Output Explanation:
There are two ways to multiply the chain - A1*(A2*A3) or (A1*A2)*A3.
If we multiply in order- A1*(A2*A3), then number of multiplications required are 15000.
If we multiply in order- (A1*A2)*A3, then number of multiplications required are 8000.
Thus minimum number of multiplications required are 8000.
